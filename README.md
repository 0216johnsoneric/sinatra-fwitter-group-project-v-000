### Some Hints on Working Together 

Working on a software project with another person is not something to be taken lightly. While you are a fantastic coder solo, software development is a collaborative activity. Just like anything else, there is skill in collaborating on code. In the end, collaborating with another person boils down to three different styles:

  - Pair - Pair the entire time working linearly together
  - Pass - 1 person does 1 requirement and then the next person does the next one
  - Parallel - work on different parts at the same time by agreeing on interfaces and stubs and meeting in the middle

Remember! The goal at The Flatiron School is not to do, it is to *learn*. Make sure you have worked in all three styles of collaboration. We want you to learn how the different styles works, and make sure that together you and your partner understand every part of the code.
